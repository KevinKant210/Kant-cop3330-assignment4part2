So your the new guy around here, lemme guess REY sent you that sly son of a gun.

Well to use this amazing wonderful perfect application you will need all but 3 brain cells and this wonderful guide.

  The first screen you run into in this application is the main menu where you can either create a new ToDo List or load a previously made one
  If you decide to create a new list then you simply need to click the new list button and you will be brought to the list menu
  
  If you decide to load a list you will get brought to the loading screen where you can browse your wonderful computer for the list you wish to load and it will be handled automagically
  
  
  Once you open a list you will come on the list management screen where you will see a table with all your tasks and a plethora of fun buttons to play with
  
  First the save list button will take you to a save list window where you can easily select a filename and a place to store the new file 
  
  Next up are the display buttons they will display items in the list depending on which one you hit
    Display All gets every task and displays them
    Display Complete only gets every completed task and displays them
    Display Incomplete only gets every incomplete task and displays them
    
   Clear List will clear out all tasks form the list DELETING THEM
   
   Change title will bring you to the change title screen where you can change the title of your list
   
   You can add new items to the list at the button with the add list button but make sure you fill out the description and choose a due date first.
    A description should be less then 256 characters or else you will recieve and error
    
   Once you add an item you can edit it by clicking on it in the table typing in a new description or due date and clicking Edit Item
   
   You can similarly mark an item complete by clicking on it in the table then clicking the Mark Complete Button
   
   Once again selecting an item from the table and clicking delete selected item does what anyone could think it does and deleted the item you just selected ( wow )
   
   If you are feeling fancy you can sort your tasks by due date simply by clicking on the due-date column
    the same can be done to the description column where it is sorted lexographically
    you can also do this with the completed field but shhhhh use the display buttons i worked so hard on thanks.
    
    once you are done editing and managing your magic tasks you can save the list as mentioned above with the save button
      once in the save window you simply need to choose a name and select where you want the list saved, it will save it to a easily readable text file for you that you can load later!
      
    last thing is have fun and dont procrastinate!
